## Problem 1

The graph below demonstrates the probability that there is at least 1
shared birthday in a group of individuals from a group of 2 people to 50
simulated over 10,000 trials.

As noted in the graph. As the group sizes increase, the probabiliyt of a
shared birthday also increases. Interestingly, even though there are 365
possible birthdays. The probability of a shared birthday among a group
of 25 people is already over 50% and that of a group of 50 people is
nearly 100%!
