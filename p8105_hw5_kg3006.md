## Problem 1

The graph below demonstrates the probability that there is at least 1
shared birthday in a group of individuals from a group of 2 people to 50
simulated over 10,000 trials.

As noted in the graph. As the group sizes increase, the probabiliyt of a
shared birthday also increases. Interestingly, even though there are 365
possible birthdays. The probability of a shared birthday among a group
of 25 people is already over 50% and that of a group of 50 people is
nearly 100%!

## Problem 2

### Part A

This figure shows that at mean of 0, the power to detect a differnece is
0.05, as we increased the true mean value, the power to detect a
difference also increases and approaches 100% by a true mean value of 4.

### Part B

The simulated value of mu in our simmulation with 5,000 simulation
approximates that of the true value of mu quite well.
